# Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview

This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms with a focus on energy efficiency. The simulator evaluates performance metrics such as **turnaround time**, **waiting time**, and **energy consumption** during both task execution and idle CPU periods.

The goal of this project is to provide insights into the trade-offs between traditional CPU performance metrics and energy consumption when using different scheduling algorithms.

## Features

- Implements the following CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)**
  - **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
  - **Round Robin (RR)**
  - **Priority Scheduling**
- Calculates and displays the following performance metrics:
  - **Turnaround Time**
  - **Waiting Time**
  - **Energy Consumption (during execution and idle periods)**
- Simulates the energy consumed by the CPU during both active task execution and idle periods.
- Outputs performance data in a readable format, including Gantt charts and tables summarizing the metrics.

## Installation

To get started with the CPU Scheduling Simulator, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (or any other language based on your implementation)
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt` or installable via `pip`)
